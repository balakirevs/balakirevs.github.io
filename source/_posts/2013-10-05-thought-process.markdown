Today, I was about to Tweet something on Twitter. As I was looking down my activity feed, I thought to myself: "what is a Tweet in the past?"

<!-- more -->

Here's how my mind unfolded that question:

> Is a tweet in the past a twot or a twit?

> Maybe a twittwot?

> Or twittertotter? (like pitter-patter, right?)

> Teeter-totter? (briefly reminisce childhood memories)

> TATER TOTS! (I don't even like breakfast)

> Food.

Now re-read in Ellen Degeneres's Dory voice in Finding Nemo.

Welcome to my life.
