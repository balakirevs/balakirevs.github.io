<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer that UI should always supersede functionality, especially in the case of new webapps. People generally lash out when I say such things, but when you&rsquo;re starting a small company or launching a new product, a fully functional website does you no good if people don&rsquo;t know how to use it. Conversely, a buggy website with helpful, encouraging error handlers will encourage users to keep coming back.</p>

<p>Think about it this way &ndash; if Facebook suddenly went down, would you come back in an hour? If Facebook never threw any errors and was &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;, yet it was totally unusable, would you still use it? Probably not!</p>

<blockquote><p>A functional UI is more important than a functional app.</p></blockquote>

<p>Developers should spend more time analyzing user-testing instead of debugging features. While I don&rsquo;t condone releasing a buggy application, I&rsquo;d much rather see a pretty application with a few bugs released over a perfect application that only developers know how to use.</p>

<p>Development is often thought of in the opposite direction &ndash; get your database structure and &ldquo;code&rdquo;; written, and then move on to making the application look pretty. I completely despise this ideology! End users don&rsquo;t care about code! They don&rsquo;t care that your database is in third normal form. They want things that look fancy! Fade in/fade out transitions, slide up/slide downs, spinners when things are loading &ndash; these are things that users want!</p>

<p>All too often developers are concerned with making their code faster, better, or prettier, yet they fail to remember the end user! Add drag/drop where you can, make things as intuitive as possible, and don&rsquo;t forget the end user! Make your 404s and 500s informative and encourage users to return.</p>
